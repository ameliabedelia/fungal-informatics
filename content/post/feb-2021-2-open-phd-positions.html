<p>We are recruiting 2 PhD student to investigate how cross-kingdom interactions of environmental fungi in their native niche shapes pathogenicity in humans. One position will be mostly lab-based, while the other will be primarily computational. However, candidates with an interest or experience in both areas are also encouraged to apply!</p>
<p><strong>The required for qualifications for both positions are:</strong><br />
- Masters degree (or equivalent) with research-based thesis.<br />
- Very good communication skills in English.</p>
<p><strong>The specific requirements for the bioinformatics PhD position are:</strong><br />
- Knowledge and expertise in the analysis of biological high-throughput data.<br />
- Knowledge in statistical methods in the context of biological systems.<br />
- Experience with programming (Python, Perl, R, or C++).</p>
<p><strong>The specific requirements for the wet lab positions are:</strong><br />
- Laboratory experience in microbiology, molecular biology, and/or biochemistry<br />
- Basic knowledge of programming (R, python) for data analysis and statistics<br />
- Prior experience working with microbial communities and/or metagenomic data would be an asset, but not required</p>
