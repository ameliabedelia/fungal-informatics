**The main tasks of this PhD project include:**  
- Defining metagenomic communities and microbial interaction networks involving human-pathogenic
fungi.  
- Delineating shared and niche-specific response patterns among ecological and human-associated environments.  


**The required qualifications are:**  
- Masterâ€™s degree (or equivalent) in bioinformatics, computational biology, microbiology, biochemistry,
computer science, or a related discipline.  
- Knowledge and expertise in the analysis of biological high-throughput data.  
- Knowledge in statistical methods in the context of biological systems.  
- Experience with programming (Python, Perl, R, or C++).  
- Very good communication skills in English.  

**Applications can be made until December 3, 2020**.
