<p>The <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/pathology/microbiology-immunology/mmtss/">Medical Mycology Trainee Seminar Series</a> is a newly launched platform that allows new faculty, postdocs, and PhD students a platform to present their work virtually to the global medical mycology community. Amelia Barber (Leibniz-HKI, Jena, Germany) and José Vargas-Muñiz (SIU, Carbondale, IL, USA) gave the inaugural lectures in what promises to be a great seminar series.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to present our work on <strong><em>Searching for the source: how environmental fungi become clinically resistant</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Video of the presentations can be watched below.</p>
