abstract = "The opportunistic pathogen *Candida glabrata* shows a concerning increase in drug resistance. Here, we present the analysis of two serial bloodstream isolates, obtained 12 days apart. Both isolates show pan-azole resistance and echinocandin resistance was acquired during the sampling interval. Genome sequencing identified nine nonsynonymous SNVs between the strains, including a S663P substitution in *FKS2* and previously undescribed SNVs in *MDE1* and *FPR1*, offering insight into how C. glabrata acquires drug resistance and adapts to a human host."
