Hi Malou! I have started the template for your bio page, but would like you to finish it. More specifically, here is what needs your input:
- Add a few interests (research or personal!) to the YAML header above
- If you have want to include links to your github, twitter, or google scholar accounts, uncomment those lines above and add web links to them
- Delete this text below the YAML header (starting with "Hi Malou") and add a few sentences about yourself, your project, goals you have for your phd. Anything you want! You can also look at my file (content/authors/amelia/_index.md) for inspiration, but can write whatever you want
- Add a photo that you are willing to share on the website to the folder content/authors/malou/. Save this photo as avatar.jpg

When you are done editing, submit a pull request with your changes! You can change the information displayed on this page as often as you want! Just submit a new pull request. ;-)
