Marie-Louise (Malou) Körner is a new doctoral researcher in bioinformatics. Her PhD project is centered on understanding how fungal-bacterial interactions in the environment shape human pathogenicity in fungi.  
  
Malou studied Molecular Life Science (B.Sc.) and Computer Science (M.Sc.) at the University of Lübeck, Germany. During her Master's, she spent seven months in Cartagena, Spain, doing an internship at the Institute of Plant Biotechnology of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena. After her graduation, she worked as a project coordinator in the bioinformatics department of the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig, Germany.  

She loves traveling and languages, (cooperative) board games, as well as being outdoors and is looking forward to meeting new colleagues in the group :)
