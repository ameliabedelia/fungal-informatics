Marie-Louise (Malou) Körner is a new doctoral researcher in bioinformatics, joining the junior research group Fungal Informatics in October 2020. Her PhD project is on understanding how fungal-bacterial interactions in the environment shape human pathogenicity in these fungal species. 
To this end, she will analyse the targeted-amplicon and shotgun metagenomic datasets generated by the Fungal Informatics group and build interaction networks of bacteria and fungi in order to characterize the microbial communities that human-pathogenic fungi participate in in their native environment.  
Malou studied Molecular Life Science (B.Sc.) and Computer Science (M.Sc.) at the University of Lübeck, Germany. During her Master's, she spent seven months in Cartagena, Spain, doing an internship at the Institute of Plant Biotechnology of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena.
After her graduation she worked as a project coordinator in the bioinformatics department of the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig, Germany.  
She loves travelling and languages, (cooperative) board games, as well as being outdoors and is looking forward to meeting new colleagues for the group :)
